<div class="franklin-content"><h1 id="post_title"><a href="#post_title" class="header-anchor">Problems with Julia</a></h1>
<h2 id="subheading"><a href="#subheading" class="header-anchor">Why I am confident that Julia is production-ready</a></h2>
<p>Two of the most common reasons that I tend to hear regarding why people don&#39;t want to use Julia in work-related projects or in their production environments are,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Julia is still a young language,</p>
</li>
<li><p>Julia doesn&#39;t have widespread adoption.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even though I&#39;m a bit of a Julia fanboy, it&#39;s not without numerous reasons. Furthermore, among those aforementioned reasons are, in my opinion, reasons which specifically invalidate the two &quot;problems&quot; I often hear.</p>
<h2 id="julia_is_still_a_young_language"><a href="#julia_is_still_a_young_language" class="header-anchor">Julia is still a young language</a></h2>
<p>This is usually a compound reason since there are just a lot of things that happen <em>over time</em>. Bugs get worked out, communities grow, <em>other</em> people run into the problems we may run into and post their solutions on the web, and things just happen to improve as a whole. It&#39;s just the natural course for <em>any</em> language.</p>
<p>That being said, it&#39;s worth noting that while I am not completely against taking risks, I tend to be fairly extensive on the mitigation side, bordering obsessive over what <em>could</em> go wrong and trying to think of ways to combat those potentials in the case they do happen to occur, even if when they seem unlikely.</p>
<p>So why does Julia&#39;s youthfulness not bother me at all? It&#39;s because there aren&#39;t many languages which have given me as few problems as Julia with respect to version conflicts or integrating external packages and libraries.</p>
<p>Prior to Julia hitting version 1, issues were a bit more frequent due to larger syntactical changes from release to release. As of v1.6.1, there are a few libraries I&#39;ll run across, generally for really specific, niche purposes, which are written in v0.6 or similar and haven&#39;t been updated, where I&#39;ll run into compiling issues.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also run into some problems compiling Julia from source on OSX, albeit I&#39;ve never had any compiling issues on any Linux flavours.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the few issues that I have occasionally run into with Julia, have been easily fixed where I didn&#39;t even need to do any web searching, but was able to check an error log or message and make a small adjustment which got me back on track. Furthermore, I&#39;ve <em>never</em> run into any problems which created security vulnerabilities or problems which impacted the functionality or output of my code. I compare this to numerous other languages which are currently deeply engrained into the current software development landscape which have done serious damage or created vast security vulnerabilities, and sometimes <em>silently</em>.</p>
<p>It may be a young language, but the people in the Julia community tend to be extremely talented scientists and engineers. </p>
<p>With Julia still being fairly young and without wide adoption, often times the problems I have run into don&#39;t have easily resolvable solutions and have required a decent bit of web searching or even needing to post on Github or discourse and await a response from a fellow Julia-friendly.</p>
<p>That all being said, I <em>rarely</em> run into problems. Even NodeJS being older than Julia and with its <em>massive</em> community and forced, non-negotiable adoption by all, I am always running into conflicts, silently created vulnerabilities, or other serious issues. With Julia, I run into a miniscule fraction of issues comparably and they are easily resolved. </p>
