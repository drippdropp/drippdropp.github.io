<div class="franklin-content"><h1 id="post_title"><a href="#post_title" class="header-anchor">Learning New Information</a></h1>
<p>When it comes to learning about new things, re-learning old things, and ultimatley retaining information, I&#39;ve developed the following system which works great for me. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I&#39;ve never actually taken the time to learn about the process Richard Feynman used for learning things, I believe my system may be similar or at least I believe he recommended teaching the ideas to another person as I outline in the third step of my system.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>I read about a topic, listen to someone talk about it or teach it, and write down key ideas. This is really just the first step where I receive the information. During this time, I try to make as many connections to other things as possible, think of analogies, and think about the <em>why</em>. The mantra here is, &quot;Why is this done? Why is it done this way? Why does this information have value?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once I have the general gist of what is going on, I like to try to apply it in some sort of way. For example, if it&#39;s a mathematical method, I will try doing some problems or writing some code to computational do said problems. If you&#39;re a programming, writing code is a great way to learn computational methods because you need to think through all of the cases, understate what is happening under the hood, and as an experienced engineer, I find that I tend to think about what it is I&#39;m learning in a very wholistic yet specific manner by default. If it&#39;s a new programming language, I will do some code challenges with the language. If it&#39;s a new spoken language, I will try reading a book in the language or talk to someone in it. The mantra at this stage is, &quot;How does it work? How does it happen? How can I apply this knowledge?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once I&#39;ve successfully applied the information or knowledge, the next step is to try and teach it to someone else. In some cases, I will write an article about it so I can, a.&#41; explain it in my own words, b.&#41; plus persist what I&#39;ve written so I can always refer back to it later. The mantra at this stage is, &quot;How can I communicate these ideas to another person? How can I make someone understand? How can I make someone appreciate this knowledge?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the last stage, I revisit. One time I read that when we learn things we really just retain it for some fairly short period of time and by returning to the material over a period of several weeks we can solidify our retention of the information. I will re-read my old posts and notes, often making new connections and adjusting the writings. I usually try and teach it to another person at this point, even if it&#39;s just a matter of explaining the high-level to them. It&#39;s especially valuable for me to need to explain it to someone who isn&#39;t familiar with the field in general as it requires me to keep things as simple as possible and not skip important parts. While I may be fairly &quot;hand wavey&quot; in these explanations, it&#39;s important to realize that by keeping everything as simple as possible such that I only go over the most important and fundamental parts. The win-win here is that, I only go over the most important and fundamental parts so I can truly emphasize those in my own mind and it does a good job of re-affirming my understanding and solidifying the information.</p>
