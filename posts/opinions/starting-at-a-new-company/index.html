<div class="franklin-content"><h1 id="post_title"><a href="#post_title" class="header-anchor">Starting at a New Company</a></h1>
<p>After more than eight years at my current company, I&#39;m making a move. It&#39;s really exciting because this new role is great fit for me and I&#39;ll be able to utilize the full spectrum of my skills and experience to work on an amazing product that I both believe in and feel like can make a lot of positive change in the world. Nonetheless, whenever changing jobs, it&#39;s important to take a step back, get some perspective, and make a plan for the first few months and beyond.</p>
<p>I often say in order to know where we are going, we need to first know where we are. I reached out to a number of different individuals in my network and asked for honest feedback: what do you think my weaknesses are and is there anything that stands out from our time together that I could&#39;ve done or handled better? In order to grow, we need that sort of external perspective.</p>
<p>I want to make sure to build strong relationships with leadership and with the wider company. I&#39;ll want to start off by having a conversation to know what is expected of me so I will know that I&#39;m meeting or exceeding those expectations. I want to build trust with the team and that starts with me knowing I&#39;m helping to move things in the right direction. Additionally, to help build trust, I want to be as consistent as possible. I want the team to know they can count on me â€“ that I&#39;m capable, available, and dedicated.</p>
<p>Next, I will be asking a lot of questions.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t necessarily need to know every single nut and bolt, but I do need to understand how all the pieces fit together and ultimately how data flows through the system. Data is like the blood of a company&#39;s body. It transmits information between different parts of the architecture, being used to make decisions, run applications, and process revenue. The  data must keep flowing. This means it&#39;s a topic we need to spend a little more time on. I want to know how the data comes into the system, how it flows through the system, what departments are using what, and how are we storing it?</p>
<p>There will be times when that data doesn&#39;t flow correctly. So, how do we know when the system isn&#39;t working? How is 24/7 coverage currently being handled? Do we have disaster recovery in place? What are we using for notifications? Do we perform root cause analysis following outages?</p>
<p>I want to know how much time is being spent performing maintenance and fixing bugs compared with time spent on the core mission? Who proposes new features and functionality? What version control are we using? How are we tracking tasks? How are we managing and maintaining technical documentation? Who are the subject matter experts for key components of the system?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>learning a new business</p>
</li>
<li><p>get familiarized with the system architecture</p>
</li>
<li><p>get familiarized with the product or application&#40;s&#41;</p>
</li>
<li><p>get familiarized with the data?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- data is the lifeblood of any company. I ask questions like what kind of data do we have and what have you been using it for -- how has it been helping you? Are there any</p>
<p>establishing yoruself with your new coworkers</p>
